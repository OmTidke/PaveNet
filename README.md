# Overview
PaveGuard is a cutting-edge solution aimed at enhancing urban environment image segmentation using a novel UNet architecture. This project leverages deep residual networks combined with the powerful UNet model to achieve multi-class segmentation of street images. The lightweight design of the model makes it suitable for embedded systems, where efficient computation and high precision are required.

# Key Features:
High accuracy of 88.9%.
Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 51.19.
Optimized for embedded systems with limited resources.
Effective in real-time applications like autonomous vehicles and delivery robots.
Dataset
The project utilizes the CamVid dataset, which contains:

700+ annotated images.
32 semantic classes of urban elements (buildings, traffic signs, trees, etc.).

# Methodology
The Enhanced ResUNet architecture is built on the traditional UNet model with improvements using Residual Learning. This results in a more lightweight and accurate model for image segmentation tasks in urban settings.

## The architecture consists of three major parts:

1. Encoder
2. Bridge
3. Decoder

Future Work
We aim to further optimize the architecture and explore additional datasets to improve the model's generalization capabilities. In particular, we plan to fine-tune hyperparameters and investigate better data augmentation techniques to enhance segmentation accuracy.
